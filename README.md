# Virtual Desktop Switcher
A small program to be able to switch virtual desktops by hovering the mouse curser near an edge of the screen. 

This program is made for Windows 10 but due to how it sends the command to switch desktops (by keyboard shortcut), it can easily be used for all OSs that support virtual desktops or anything else really.

This library depends on [JNativeHook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook "JNativeHook")
